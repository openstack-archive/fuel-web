fuel-web
========

fuel-web (nailgun) implements REST API and deployment data
management. It manages disk volumes configuration data, networks
configuration data and any other environment specific data which
are necessary for successful deployment. It has required
orchestration logic to build instructions for provisioning
and deployment in a right order. Nailgun uses SQL database
to store its data and AMQP service to interact with workers.
