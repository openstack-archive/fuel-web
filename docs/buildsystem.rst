Fuel build system
=================

Use the `fuel-main repository <https://github.com/stackforge/fuel-main.git>`_ to build Fuel components such as an ISO or an upgrade tarball.
This repository contains a set of GNU Make build scripts.

Quick start
-----------

1. You must use one of the following distributions to build Fuel components or the build process may fail:

* Ubuntu 12.04
* Ubuntu 14.04

2. Check if you have git installed in
   your system. To do that, use the following command:

::

   which git

3. Clone the fuel-main git repository to the location where
   you will work. The root of your repo will be named `fuel-main`.
   In this example, it will be located under the *~/fuel* directory.

::

   mkdir ~/fuel
   cd ~/fuel
   git clone https://github.com/stackforge/fuel-main.git
   cd fuel-main


.. note::Fuel build system consists of the following components:

       * a shell script (**./prepare-build-env.sh**) -  prepares the build environment by checking
          that all necessary packages are installed and installing any that are not.

       * **fuel-main** directory - the only one required repository for building the Fuel ISO.

       The make script then downloads the additional components (Fuel Library, Nailgun, Astute and OSTF).
       Unless otherwise specified in the makefile, the master branch of each respective repo is used to build the ISO.

4. Run the shell script:

::

   ./prepare-build-env.sh

  and wait until **prepare-build-env.sh**
  installs the Fuel build evironment on your computer.

5. After the script runs successfully, issue the following command to build a
   Fuel ISO:

::

   make iso

6. Use the following command to list the available make targets:

::

   make help

For the full list of available targets with description, see **Build targets** section below.

Build system structure
----------------------

Fuel consists of several components such as web interface,
puppet modules, orchestration components, testing components.
Source code of all those components is split into multiple git
repositories like:

https://github.com/stackforge/fuel-web
https://github.com/stackforge/fuel-astute
https://github.com/stackforge/fuel-ostf
https://github.com/stackforge/fuel-library
https://github.com/stackforge/fuel-docs

Nevertheless, the main component of the Fuel build system is
*fuel-main* directory.
Fuel build processes are quite complicated,
so to make the fuel-main code easily maintainable, it is
split into a bunch of files and directories. Those files
and directories contain independent (or at least almost independent)
pieces of Fuel build system:

* **Makefile** - This is the main make file which includes all other make modules.

* **config.mk** - Contains parameters used to customize the build process,
  specifying items such as build paths,
  upstream mirrors, source code repositories and branches, built-in default Fuel settings, and ISO name

* **rules.mk** - Defines frequently-used macros.

* **repos.mk** - Contains make scripts to download the
  other repositories that are required to develop Fuel
  components. Fuel contains separate repos for
  the web interface, puppet modules, orchestration components, and testing components.

* **sandbox.mk** - Shell script definitions that create and destroy the
  special chroot environment required to build some components. For example For example, for building RPM packages,
  CentOS images we use CentOS chroot environment. This file contains
  shell script definitions for creating and destroying such
  chroot environments.

* **mirror** - Fuel is a tool which allows one to deploy Openstack
  over one of two operating systems: CentOS and Ubuntu.
  One can deploy their cluster even if Internet connection
  is unavailable. It is possible because Fuel provides
  fully functional CentOS and Ubuntu mirrors on a master node.
  This directory contains the code which is used to download
  all necessary packages from upstream mirrors and build new
  ones which are to be copied on Fuel ISO.

* **puppet** - This directory contains the code which is used
  to pack Fuel puppet modules into a tarball which then
  is put on Fuel ISO.

* **packages** - All Fuel components are distributed as DEB
  and RPM packages. This directory contains DEB and RPM
  specs as well as make code for building those packages.
  Those packages are included in Fuel DEB and RPM mirrors.
  And then they are supposed to be available
  to install them on Fuel master and slave nodes.

* **bootstrap** - One of the main features of Fuel is
  auto-discovering of nodes which are available for Openstack deployment.
  Nodes in a data center are supposed to boot via PXE from
  Fuel master node with so called **bootstrap** kernel and
  miniroot (a.k.a initrd or initramfs). Bootstrap is CentOS
  based in-memory OS which does not install anything on a hard
  drive but provides a discovery agent which gathers information
  about node's hardware and publishes it on a master node.
  This fuel-main directory contains a make script intended
  to build that CentOS based miniroot image.

* **image** - Fuel provides two options of the way of installing
  OS on target nodes in a cluster. One option is so-called
  "Classic" way  means using standard OS installers
  (anaconda for CentOS and debian-installer for Ubuntu).
  Second is so-called "Image"-based way which provides
  copying pre-built CentOS or Ubuntu image on a hard drive on
  a slave node. This directory contains make scripts for
  building CentOS and Ubuntu images using Fuel mirrors
  which are supposed to have been built using scripts in
  the **mirror** directory.

* **docker** - Most of services on Fuel master node are run inside
  Docker containers. Container-based model provides several advantages:
  it allows significant simplify
  the process of master node upgrade. This fuel-main directory
  contains make scripts intended to build docker containers which
  are to be deployed on a master node.

* **upgrade** - As mentioned above, Fuel master node
  can be upgraded from one version to another. Fuel ISO allows
  one install Fuel master node on a bare server while
  Fuel upgrade tarball allows one to upgrade an existing master node.
  This directory contains make scripts for building Fuel upgrade tarball.

* **iso** - The easiest way to use Fuel is to download Fuel ISO
  image and install CentOS based operating system on a bare
  hardware using this ISO. This directory contains make scripts
  for building Fuel ISO.

Fuel-main also contains a set of directories which are not directly
related to Fuel build processes. Those directories are the following ones:

* **virtualbox** - This directory contains a set of shell scripts
  which allow one to easily deploy Fuel demo lab using Virtualbox.
  Those scripts work fine both on Linux and on MacOS.

* **utils** - It is just a set of utilities used for maintaining Fuel components.
* **fuelweb_test** and **fuelweb_ui_test** - These directories contain
  the code of Fuel system tests.


Build targets
-------------

* **all** - This target is used for building all Fuel artifacts.
  Currently it is just an alias for **iso** target.

* **bootstrap** - This target is used for building in-memory bootstrap
  image which is used for auto-discovering.

* **mirror** - This target is used for building local mirrors. Local mirrors are
  the copies of CentOS and Ubuntu mirrors which are then placed into Fuel ISO.
  Those mirrors contain all necessary packages including those listed in
  requirements-*.txt files with their dependencies as well as those which
  are Fuel packages. Packages listed in requirements-*.txt files are downloaded
  from upstream mirrors while Fuel packages are built from source code.

* **iso** - This target is used for building Fuel ISO. If build succeeds,
  ISO is put into build/artifacts.

* **img** - This target is used for building Fuel flash stick image.
  This image is binary copied to a flash stick and then that
  stick is supposed to be used as a bootable device. This stick image
  contains Fuel ISO as well as some auxiliary boot files.

* **upgrade** ????

* **clean** - This target removes build directory.

* **deep_clean** - This target removes build directory and local mirror. If you
  remove local mirror then next time you build ISO build job is going to
  download all necessary packages again. So it is much faster when keeping
  local mirror.


Customizing build process
-------------------------

There are plenty of variables in make files. Some of them represent
a kind of build parameters. They are defined in **config.mk**. See the following
build parameters list:

* **TOP_DIR**. By default, this variable is a current directory. All other build
  directories are relative to this path.

* **BUILD_DIR**. This is where all files, used during build process are placed.
  By default, it is **$(TOP_DIR)/build**.

* **ARTS_DIR**. This is where build artifacts such as ISO and IMG files
  are supposed to be put. By default it is **$(BUILD_DIR)/artifacts**.

* **LOCAL_MIRROR**. This is where local CentOS and Ubuntu mirrors
  are to be placed. By default it is **$(TOP_DIR)/local_mirror**.

* **DEPS_DIR**.Some of build targets are supposed to depend on artifacts
  of the previous build jobs. So, this directory is where those artifacts are
  supposed to be placed before build starts. By default, it is **$(TOP_DIR)/deps**.

* **ISO_NAME**. This is a name of Fuel ISO without file extension.
  E.g. if **ISO_NAME** = **MY_CUSTOM_NAME**, then Fuel ISO file will
  be placed into **$(MY_CUSTOM_NAME).iso**.

* **ISO_PATH**. Alternatively, one can define Fuel ISO full path instead of defining
  just ISO name. By default, it is **$(ARTS_DIR)/$(ISO_NAME).iso**.

* **UPGRADE_TARBALL_NAME**. This variable defines the name of upgrade tarball.
  Upgrade file will be named **$(UPGRADE_TARBALL_NAME).tar**.

* **UPGRADE_TARBALL_PATH**. Alternatively, one can define full upgrade tarball path.
  By default, it is **$(ARTS_DIR)/$(UPGRADE_TARBALL_NAME).tar**.

* **VBOX_SCRIPTS_NAME**. This variables defines the name of the archive which
  contains Virtualbox scripts. This archive will be placed into **$(VBOX_SCRIPTS_NAME).zip**.

* **VBOX_SCRIPTS_PATH**. One can define full path for
  Virtualbox scripts archive. By default, it is **$(ARTS_DIR)/$(VBOX_SCRIPTS_NAME).zip**

Fuel ISO contains some default settings for a master node. One can customize those
settings using the following variables:

* **MASTER_IP**. This is master node IP address. Default is 10.20.0.2.
* **MASTER_NETMASK**.  This is master node IP netmask. Default is 255.255.255.0.
* **MASTER_GW**. This is master node default gateway. Default is 10.20.0.1.
* **MASTER_DNS**. This is where upstream DNS for a master node is located.
  Master node DNS will redirect there all dns requests which it is not able to resolve itself.
  By default it is 10.20.0.1.

These settings can be customized during Fuel Master node installation.

Other options
-------------

- BUILD_OPENSTACK_PACKAGES - list of openstack packages to be rebuilt from source.

- [repo]_REPO - remote source code repo. URL or git repository can be specified for each of the Fuel components. Hereineafter repo is one of the following: FUELLIB, NAILGUN, ASTUTE, OSTF.

- [repo]_COMMIT - source branch for each of the Fuel components to build.

- [repo]_GERRIT_URL - gerrit repo.

- USE_MIRROR - Use pre-built mirrors from Fuel infrastructure.
  The following mirrors can be used:  ext (external mirror, available from outside of
  Mirantis network), srt (Saratov), msk (Moscow), hrk (Kharkov) or none (reserved for building
  local mirrors, i.e. this case CentOS and Ubuntu packages will be fetched from upstream mirrors, so
  that it will make the build process much slower).It is recommended to choose a mirror that is geographically closest to the build
  server to speed up the ISO build process.

- MIRROR_UBUNTU - Download ubuntu packages from a specific remote repo.

- MIRROR_DOCKER - Download docker images from a specific remote url.

- MIRROR_FUEL - Download Fuel centos packages from this repo. Should be converted to external url.

- MIRROR_FUEL_UBUNTU - Download Fuel ubuntu packages from this repo. Should be converted to external url.

- EXTRA_RPM_REPOS - extra repos with rpm packages. Each repo must be comma separated tuple with repo-name and repo-path.
  Repos must be separated by space, e.g.
  *qemu2,http://osci-obs.vm.mirantis.net:82/centos-fuel-5.1-stable-15943/centos/ libvirt,http://osci-obs.vm.mirantis.net:82/centos-fuel-5.1-stable-17019/centos/*.

- EXTRA_DEP_REPOS - extra repos with deb packages.  Each repo must consist of an url, dist and section parts.
  Repos must be separated by bar, e.g.
