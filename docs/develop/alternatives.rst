Alternatives
============

Metadata via Puppet ENC (part of architecture)
----------------------------------------------

This is alternative possible architecture.
See corresponding sequence diagram and more information here: :ref:`deploy_via_enc_sequence`.

Alternative Implementation for deployment via ENC
-------------------------------------------------

  :align: center
  :width: 100%

Alternative schema of deployment is different in following:

* Naily stores all data about deployment into YAML file before the deployment, and then calls Orchestrator
* Orchestrator loads nodes information from YAML and calls puppet via MCollective
* Puppet requests data from Puppet master
* Puppet uses `ENC extension <http://docs.puppetlabs.com/guides/external_nodes.html>`_ to get information what
  classes should be applied on particular node. If try to explain in a few
  words what ENC is - it is Puppet Master's extension to call external user defined script
* ENC script loads all required data from YAML file
* YAML file could be replaced by some NoSQL DB

Comparison of deployment approaches
-----------------------------------

Data from Facter
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Pros:

* Easy. Put file on node via MCollective, and we know what will be executed there. It's easy to check what have been
  executed last time.
* No additional stateful components. Otherwise it could lead to data inconsistency
* Easy to switch into configuration without Puppet Master or even replace it to Chef Solo
* Requires time to place data on nodes before puppet run, and implementation in syncronious way - puppet should not
  run before the node receive it's role.

Cons:

* Doesn't look like a "Puppet" way, when desired state of Cluster should be defined beforeahead and Puppet
  will converge the existing state to the desired state

Data from ENC
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Pros:

* "Puppet" way, everything what is needed is defined in YAML file
* All information could be found in one place - YAML file

Cons:

* Naily should know the data structure in YAML file to do the merge. (however it can just call Orchestrator with
  metadata, and Orchestrator will write data to YAML file)
* Requires additional stateful component - YAML file, what may lead to data inconsistency
* Puppet Master must be installed on the same node as Orchestrator (to access YAML file). Even if YAML file
  is replaced to NoSQL DB, ENC script still has to be present on Puppet Master node.
* With increase of deployment complexity and metadata, YAML file will increase in size. It also should contain
  information about all clusters and all nodes consequently, which could become a bottleneck for loading data
  in case of hundrends nodes and thousand requests. Separation of YAML structure in cluster-based will not help
  because there will be need to pass cluster identifier to puppet, what's unclear how to do besides facter
  extension.
* More complex code for Naily(or Orchestrator) is required to do merges of existing data in YAML file and new data,
  code to prevent concurrency issues. It would be even more complex with Updates feature, when it would require
  of a sequence of actions performed in a specific order.
* Let's say we have attribute { 'keystone' => { 'data_dir' => '/var/lib/keystone' } }, and we want to update our
  cluster to new version of OpenStack, node by node, where data_dir location is different. In case with NailyFact,
  it's easy - just write facts on target node and run puppet on it, other nodes will not be affected (they still
  have settings for old data_dir location). In case with data from ENC it's much more complex, because there is
  only single DB - YAML file for the whole cluster. It means it would not be possible to run puppet on old nodes
  if they should not be updated yet.
