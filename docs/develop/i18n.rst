Fuel UI Internationalization Guidelines
============================
Fuel UI internationalization is done using `i18next <http://i18next.com/>`_
library. Please read `i18next documentation
<http://i18next.com/pages/doc_features.html>`_ first.

All translations are stored in nailgun/static/i18n/translation.json

If you want to add new strings to the translations file, follow these rules:

#. Use words describing placement of strings like "button", "title", "summary",
   "description", "label" and place them at the end of the key
   (like "apply_button", "cluster_description", etc.). One-word strings may
   look better without any of these suffixes.
#. Do NOT use shortcuts ("bt" instead of "button", "descr" instead of
   "description", etc.)
#. Nest keys if it makes sense, for example, if there is a few values
   for statuses, etc.
#. If some keys are used in a few places (for example, in utils), move them to
   "common.*" namespace.
#. Use defaultValue ONLY with dynamically generated keys.
