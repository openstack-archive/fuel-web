Details on Cluster Provisioning & Deployment (via Facter extension)
-------------------------------------------------------------------
 .. uml::
    title Cluster Deployment
    actor WebUser

    Nailgun -> Naily: Provision,Deploy
    Naily -> Astute: Provision,Deploy
    Astute -> MC: Type of nodes?
    MC -> Astute: bootstrap
    Astute -> Cobbler: create system,reboot
    Astute -> MC: Type of nodes?

    MC --> Astute: booted in target OS
    Astute --> Naily: provisioned
    Naily --> Nailgun: provisioned
    Nailgun --> WebUser: status on UI
    Astute -> MC: Create /etc/astute.yaml

    Astute -> MC: run puppet
    MC -> Puppet: runonce
    Puppet -> Facter: get facts
    Facter --> Puppet: set facts and parse astute.yaml

    Puppet -> Puppet: applies $role
    Puppet --> MC: done
    MC --> Astute: deploy is done
    Astute --> Naily: deploy is done
    Naily --> Nailgun: deploy is done
    Nailgun --> WebUser: deploy is done

Once deploy and provisioning messages are accepted by Naily, provisioining 
method is called in Astute.  Provisioning part creates system in Cobbler and 
calls reboot over Cobbler. Then Astute uses `MCollective direct addressing 
mode 
<http://www.devco.net/archives/2012/06/19/mcollective-direct-addressing-mode.ph
p>`_
to check if all required nodes are available, include puppet agent on them. If 
some nodes are not yet ready, Astute waits for a few seconds and tries to
request again.  When nodes are booted in target OS, Astute uses upload_file 
MCollective plugin to push data to a special file */etc/astute.yaml* on the 
target system.
Data include role and all other variables needed for deployment. Then, Astute 
calls puppetd MCollective plugin to start deployment. Puppet is started on 
nodes.

Accordingly, puppet agent starts its run. Modules contain facter extension, 
which runs before deployment. Extension reads data from */etc/astute.yaml* 
placed by mcollective, and extends Facter data with it as a single fact, which 
is then parsed by *parseyaml* function to create *$::fuel_settings* data 
structure. This structure contains all variables as a single hash and
supports embedding of other rich structures such as nodes hash or arrays.
Case structure in running class chooses appropriate class to import,
based on *role* and *deployment_mode* variables found in */etc/astute.yaml*.
