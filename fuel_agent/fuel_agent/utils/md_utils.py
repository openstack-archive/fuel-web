    #       root cause. For unknown reason already removed md device is
    #       unexpectedly returning back after a while from time to time making
    #       new md device creation to fail.
    #           Still the actual reason of its failure is unknown, but after a
    #       searching on a web a mention was found about a race in udev
    #       http://dev.bizo.com/2012/07/mdadm-device-or-resource-busy.html
    #       The article recommends to disable udev's queue entirely during md
    #       device manipulation which sounds rather unappropriate for our case.
    #       And the link to original post on mailing list suggests to execute
    #       `udevadm settle` before removing the md device.
    #       here -> http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.linux.raid/34027
    #           So, what was done. `udevadm settle` calls were placed just
    #       before any of `mdadm` calls and the analizyng the logs was started.
    #       According to the manual `settle` is an option that "Watches the
    #       udev event queue, and exits if all current events are handled".
    #       That means it will wait for udev's finishing of processing the
    #       events. According to the logs noticeable delay had been recognized
    #       between `udevadm settle` and the next `mdadm` call.
    #           The delay was about 150-200ms or even bigger. It was appeared
    #       right before the `mdadm --stop` call. That just means that udev was
    #       too busy with events when we start to modifiy md devices hard.
    #           Thus `udevadm settle` is helping to avoid the later failure and
    #       to prevent strange behaviour of md device.
