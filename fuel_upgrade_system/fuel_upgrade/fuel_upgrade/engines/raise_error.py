class RaiseErrorUpgrader(UpgradeEngine):
    """The test upgrader intended to use in system tests.

    In order to test the rollback feature we used to inject raising error
    code in one of our upgraders in-place::

        self.fuel_web.modify_python_file(self.env.get_admin_remote(),
                                        "61i \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ raise errors."
                                        "ExecutedErrorNonZeroExitCode('{0}')"
                                        .format('Some bad error'),
                                        '/var/upgrade/site-packages/'
                                        'fuel_upgrade/engines/'
                                        'openstack.py')

    It's a bad design decision which leads to time-to-time falls in tests due
    to changes in the upgrader's code. So the class is going to solve this
    issue by providing a special upgrader which will always fail.
