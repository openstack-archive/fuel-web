    In Fuel 6.0 we have dropped legacy 'fuelweb' folder from the repos,

    this leads us to the issue when cobbler using new puppets/configs tries
    to load Ubuntu installer from repo/ubuntu/x86_64 when it's located
    in repo/ubuntu/fuelweb/x86_64.

    Generally, it's another issue that we use old installers for both
    centos/ubuntu, but it's not fixed yet, so we need to introduce
    such hack.
