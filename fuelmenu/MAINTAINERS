  For Fuel team structure and contribution policy, see [1].

  For contributions into this folder or its subfolders,
  it is mandatory to get +1 from one or more maintainers listed below,
  before asking Core Reviewers [2] for review/merge in order to decrease
  a load on Core Reviewers [3].
  Exceptions are when maintainers are actually cores, or when maintainers
  are not available for some reason (e.g. on vacation).
